 	<h3>The Writing of the book:</h3><!--Info about the characters of the book in bullet points-->
 	<ul>
 		<li>In 1868 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberts_Brothers">Thomas Niles</a>, the publisher of Louisa May Alcott, recommended that she write a book about girls that would have widespread appeal.</li>
 		<li>At first she resisted, preferring to publish a collection of her short stories. Niles pressed her to write the girls' book first, and he was aided by her father <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amos_Bronson_Alcott">Amos Bronson Alcott</a>, who also urged her to do so.</li>
 		<li>In May 1868 Alcott wrote in her journal: "Niles, partner of Roberts, asked me to write a girl's book. I said I'd try."</li>
 		<li>By June, Alcott had sent the first dozen chapters to Niles, and both agreed these were dull. But Niles' niece Lillie Almy read them and said she enjoyed them.</li>
 		<li>The completed manuscript was shown to several girls, who agreed it was "splendid.” Alcott wrote, <em>"they are the best critics, so I should definitely be satisfied."</em></li>
 		<li><strong>She wrote Little Women in record time for money, but the book's immediate success surprised both her and her publisher</strong></li>
